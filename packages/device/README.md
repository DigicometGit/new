# Castmill Device Package

This package provides a library for implementing Castmill devices for any platform. A device allows playing content
on a given device. The device could be a TV, a tablet, a phone, a desktop computer, Raspberry Pi, etc.

New devices can be added by implementing the `Machine` interface. This interface provides the machine specific methods
that are required by the device to work. You can check the integrations folder for examples on how to implement the
interface for different platforms.
