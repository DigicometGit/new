# Castmill

This is the server component of the Castmill platform. It provides the following features:
* An API for managing networks, organizations, users, devices, playlists and content.
* An admin web interface for managing all the above.
- A player server that allows devices to register, connect and play content.

## Usage

The server is implemented in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) using the [Phoenix framework](https://www.phoenixframework.org/). To start your Castmill server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
