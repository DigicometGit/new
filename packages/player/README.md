# Castmill Player Package

The Player package provides a Typescript library that implements a Castmill player.

A Player is a core component that runs on a device to play any programmed content. The player can be used as a standalone library
to show content on a web page, or it can be integrated into any device, to be used as a digital signage player.

The player is designed around the concept of widgets. A widget is a template-based component that can be used to display
any kind of information, including videos, images, text, audio, etc.

Widgets are placed in playlists which in turn allows the player to play the items in a sequence. Using the playlist as a primitive
it is also possible to design any kind of layout, where every layout section can play a different playlist.

## Install

```bash
npm install @castmill/player
