# Generic Template Widget

This widget is a generic template widget that can be used to create new widgets. It is divided in two parts,
a data model and a view. The data model defines how the data is supposed to arrive at the widget, and the
view takes care of rendering the data.

The widget supports several smart components that can be used to create resolution-independent widgets.
